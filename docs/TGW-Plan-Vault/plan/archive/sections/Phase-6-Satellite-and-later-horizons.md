## Phase 6 — Satellite and later horizons
### Satellite / client operation — disconnected catalog (PP-ADD-001)
- SQLite format already established at master level (`tgwcatalog.db`); satellite carries a filtered subset (e.g. `WHERE location IN (...)` or full copy if storage allows)
- Thumbnail cache at `catalog_root/thumbnails/<SKU>.jpg` — same relative path on satellite; partial copy synced alongside SQLite
- Dirty-flag / change-log: add `dirty` flag and `local_updated_at` column to satellite schema before dev
- Sync/promotion worker: conflict detection, merge strategy, audit trail
- API surface: pull catalog updates (delta from master SQLite), push local changes to master
- Admin UI: per-node sync status, pending migrations
- Decision required before dev: conflict resolution policy (last-write-wins vs. manual review)
### Linux / Android GUI application (PP-ADD-002)
- Technology spike: Flutter, Tauri, or Qt (target: Linux x86_64 + ARM, Android 10+)
- Catalog browser queries `tgwcatalog.db` directly (SQLite); thumbnails served from `thumbnails/<SKU>.jpg`
- Catalog editor: field-level edit writes to item JSON via tgw-api, then enqueues `catalog-rebuild` + `thumbnail-gen`
- Inventory interface, settings/connection panel
- Picklist generator (PP-ADD-009) as embedded screen; QR code as first-class element
- Packaging: .deb / .AppImage for Linux; signed .apk / Play Store for Android
### Backup / archive / sync integration (PP-ADD-004)
- Scheduled full + incremental backup (configurable retention policy)
- Archive tier: compress and move aged records to cold storage
- Sync engine: push/pull master ↔ satellite (evaluate reuse of PP-ADD-001 worker)
- Restore procedure and runbook (tested)
- Health dashboard: last backup time, backup size, sync lag per node
### AI runtime manager (PP-ADD-010)
- Periodic health check + update for non-pip-installed services: Claude Code, Ollama, Whisper.cpp
- All three share similar install/update pattern (binary download, checksum verify, in-place replace)
- Unified CLI: `mgr status`, `mgr update [all]`, `mgr restart <component>`
- Scheduled health check with alert on unhealthy state (log + optional notification)
### LTSP fat-client worker expansion
- Remote nodes as more hands at the same foreman
### Multi-marketplace abstraction
- Amazon, FB Marketplace
### Sales website frontend
- Affiliate self-competition
